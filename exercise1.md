I'm going to be writing about Python, a language that I have limited knowledge of, so forgive me if I make any mistakes. Pylint is the most popular Python linter according to VS Code downloads. Python appears to have a built in unit testing library called unittest. Pretty cool that you don't have to download anything unlike Jest. For integration and end-to-end testing it people seem to like Pytest. Python is interpreted so it doesn't require a build step.

Popular alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions include tools such as GitLab CI, CircleCI, and AWS CodePipeline. GitLab CI is obviously a CI solution designed to integrate with Gitlab the same way GitHub actions integrates with GitHub. CircleCI is designed to be easy to get started with like Jenkins but for companies wanting more performance and higher scale. It's also starting to invest in AI and machine learning features. AWS CodePipeline is for developers using AWS as it integrates with other AWS services.

A 6 person team is pretty small, so a cloud-based CI solution would probably suit them best. That being said it all depends on how large the scale of their project is. If they have few users and a small, low power server then again, a cloud solution would fit their needs and be lower cost. If they have a large userbase or require a lot of power however, they'd probably be better off using a self-hosted solution. It would have fewer limits on computing power, and the team could do more with the server without having to pay extra.
